MNIST is a canonical dataset used in image recognition through the history of machine learning. This project involves replicating the evolution of approaches to the solution of this problem from Logistic Regression through Support Vector Machines to Convolutional Neural Networks. I evaluate the performance, in terms of efficiency and accuracy, of different machine learning algorithms in recognizing handwritten digits.
Traditional models perform well after reducing the number of features. Deep learning methods perform better both in efficiency and accuracy.
